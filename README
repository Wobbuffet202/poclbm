	-d<Device ID> : Device
		Usually 0 (unless you want to mine your CPU and GPU)
		
	-f<Frames>    : Primary Frames   (works on GPU only) ***DON'T SET BELOW 3!***
		Set lower for more mining performance, or higher for less display lag.
		
	-s<Frames>    : Secondary Frames (works on GPU only) ***DON'T SET BELOW 3!***
		Press Ctrl+C to switch between primary (-f) and seconday (-l).
		
	-r<Seconds>   : Hashrate Update Interval
		1 is the default (meaning it updates every second). 
		0.5 (twice every second) is what I use, but it's up to preference.
